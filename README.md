# Restrictions

1. Not supporting Firefox at all. Really tested only with Chrome.
2. On Mac mouse events are lag-dependent, so there is slight delay in them.
3. Mac version needs itâ€™s own assets (need to be tested if they work with Linux).
4. Image recognition is relatively slow (at least on Mac). Optimization may be needed.
